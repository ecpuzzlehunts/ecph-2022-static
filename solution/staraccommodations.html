    <h2>
        Written by

    </h2>

    
    <p>At first glance, solvers are presented with 28 reviews of accommodations. Closer analysis of the reviews and their authors will reveal most the named authors are English and are linked to the city of London. Combined with the fact that a famous historical London pub "Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese" was directly named in one of the clues, and the reference to Kings Cross Station in "platform nine and three quarters", we should be clued in that the city of London is important. Eventually, we should realize the reviews reference the properties in (the international variant of) Monopoly. 
The named authors of the reviews all have a close connection to the Monopoly properties outside the board game and the reviews are written from their point of view.</p>
<p>However, many of the clues contain strange phrases that are unrelated to the Monopoly properties (e.g. vicious flying serpents, Chinese mansion names, rotting heap of corpses, seasonal/directional mansions). Careful searches with these phrases should lead us to discover they are related to the Chinese constellation system - aptly named "The Twenty-Eight Mansions". With these, we should realize each review should be paired with a Monopoly property along with a "Mansion". The reviews clue the names of the constellations along with the asterisms within them. To help further disambiguate the Mansion pairings, the review month references which season the constellation appears in, and the number of stars given in each review is equal to the numbers of stars in the constellation</p>
<p>An alternative path to figure out these 2 sets is to search for sets of 28 - which are pretty rare. Or realizing the title "Star Accommodations" is a pun/double definition cluing both sets.</p>
<p>In the given order, the pairings are as follows:</p>

<p>Therefore extracting the phrase <strong>THE ANSWER IS STREET FUNDRAISING</strong> and the answer <strong>STREET FUNDRAISING</strong>.</p>

    
    
    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>Originally, this puzzle was much harder. I wanted the solve paths for both sets to feel different. 
The original version gave much harder clues for the Monopoly properties, requiring more step-by-step elimination of choices and deduction. 
The solve path for the Constellation Mansions leaned much more heavily towards wordplay and discovery regarding the history or aspects of each of the mansions. 
However, this proved more difficult than expected for test solvers while being un-fun (a lot of reading was necessary).</p>
<p>Additionally, the answer to the puzzle was originally "ASTRONAUT TRAINING", but was changed to the current one to better fit the meta.
Combined, this led to many clues being rewritten, resulting in over 1/3rd of the clues being changed or outright rewritten.
Despite everything, it was a fun process making this puzzle.</p>
