    <p>The puzzle consists of a long list of "pieces" (answers) and eight presents, which make up a mini-meta 
collection. To solve the 8 "puzzle boxes", we must use the clues on each present, inspect the answers and sort them into their 
appropriate metas. Once the answers are sorted, it should be possible to solve the metas, all while 8 
"frozen" answers are left over. The meta answers, together with the frozen answers, will make up one 
final metameta whose solution is the final answer to the puzzle.</p>
<p>Each meta is themed after a common puzzle encoding, and the number of lines on each present ribbon 
indicates the number of answers that feed into that meta. Here are their solutions, in the order in 
which the presents are presented:</p>
<h2>Present 1</h2>
<p>Answers used by this meta:</p>
<p><tt>DAMS<br />
DARK<br />
DART<br />
DOOR<br />
EARL<br />
NEAR<br />
OMAN<br />
ONES<br />
ZANY</tt></p>
<p>This meta is based on braille, clued by the mention of "trouble seeing" and the 2-by-3 blocks. 
Based on the fact that there are four 2-by-3 blocks in the image, and the fact that the answer lists contains a large number of four-letter-long answers, we should try to encode these answers as Braille. The middle row is highlighted in the image, which means we should take particular note of it. When we decode the braille dots in the middle row as binary (braille dot = 1), and order the answers alphabetically, we can spell out the answer <strong>BLOWN SAVE</strong>.</p>
<p>(Finding the correct set of answers becomes easier if one notices that the first letter needs to have "01" in its middle braille row. This limits the answers to those that start with D, E, N, O, Y or Z, which eliminates GAUL, JUJU and STEP as possibilities.)</p>

<p>This meta is based on multi-tap, a text entry system for mobile phones. Every answer that feeds into 
this meta consists of two words. If we take the second word of each answer, and trace the path made 
by its letters on a phone keypad, the paths take the form of letters. The first words of the answers 
have unique lengths, which means we can use this as our ordering. Sorted this way, the traced letters 
spell out the answer <strong>CONTOUR</strong>. </p>

<p>This meta is based on Morse code, clued by "dotted" and "dashes". Half of the answers used here have the same length of 5. If we try to encode them as Morse, we can notice that they have a lot of dots. 
In fact, each answer only has two dashes. Furthermore, the combined number of dots and dashes is 
unique for each answer, and they can be sorted such that the numbers are consecutive.</p>
<p>The other half of the answers is clued on the right-hand side, with the clues being there solely to 
help find the right answers from the lengthy list. These answers also have unique and consecutive 
lengths, which can be matched with the number of dots and dashes of the other answers. Extract the 
letters that overlap with the positions of the dashes for the answer <strong>PRESS FORWARD</strong>.</p>

<p>This meta is based on flag semaphore. Each of the answers used here has a pair of compass 
directions (where each direction may be cardinal or ordinal), which can be translated into a semaphore letter. We can notice that the distance 
between the two compass directions ("faraway places") is unique and ranges from 2-9, which means we 
can use it to sort the letters to read out the answer <strong>CUMULATE</strong>.</p>

<p>This meta is based on the Caesar cipher. Each answer used by this meta can become a new word when 
shifted. The shifted words can be used to find unique answers to the clues that match the given 
blanks. But we're still not done - the letters from the red lines extract to the nonsensical 
"MZOEOYTAUSBN". We must now use the fact the Puzzle Santa went "there and back again", and 
Caesar shift once again. We should shift the letters of each clue answer by the same amount 
that we originally shifted the answers, but in reverse (so that we're "back where we started"). 
The newly-shifted letters spell out the answer <strong>VISIBLE LIGHT</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Metameta</h2>
<p>To solve the metameta (and the puzzle) we will need to use both the frozen answers and the meta answers. 
There is no shell this time: all information can be found in the answers.</p>
<p>Each of the remaining frozen answers contains a double letter. The double letters are A-H, which means 
we should use these to sort the answers:</p>
<p><tt>
REGIA AERONAUTICA<br />
EBB AND FLOW<br />
IONIC COMPOUND<br />
NELSON RIDDLE<br />
DUNG BEETLE<br />
EARMUFFS<br />
EASTER EGG<br />
ROUGHHOUSE
</tt></p>
<p>Now, the first letters of the frozen answers read "REINDEER". This is a clue that will become relevant 
once we look at our meta answers: BLOWN SAVE, CONTOUR, CUMULATE, DASHT RIVER, DANGER, DOMINATION, 
PRESS FORWARD and VISIBLE LIGHT. Given this puzzle's Christmas theming, the said reindeer are none other than Santa's original eight! We can now note two 
things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each meta answer shares its first 2-3 letters with one of the reindeer.</li>
<li>Santa's reindeer have a canonical order, in which they first appear in the 1823 poem <em>A Visit from St. Nicholas</em>. We can now sort the meta answers in the reindeer's order.</li>
</ul>
<p>With both the frozen answers and the meta answers sorted, we should now extract. When we collect a 
bigram from each meta answer, in the same position as the double letter in the respective frozen
answer, we can read out the final answer to the puzzle: <strong>TRANSFIGURATIONS</strong>.</p>

    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>I really like "meta-sorting" type puzzles, and wish they appeared more often in puzzle hunts.
I began working on a puzzle for this answer shortly after it got unclaimed by a different author, 
and noticed that we don't have a puzzle of this type yet. While brainstorming ideas for this answer, 
I noticed that we do not have a meta-sorting puzzle, so I knew immediately what I wanted to write. 
The metameta and the theme of Christmas and presents came about quickly, then I was stuck trying to 
write 8 winter-themed metas.</p>
<p>It was really hard to think of 8 separate metas that are all connected to winter. But while thinking of 
ideas, the semaphore compass meta came to my mind, and I immediately decided to change direction, 
and theme all of the metas around common puzzle encodings, which I feel is a much more cohesive and 
easier-to-write-for theme. Also, at this point we had two puzzles with a very strong winter theme 
(Ice Fishing and On Thin Ice), so I thought that the Christmas and present theme was just enough. </p>
<p>In a hunt with a relatively small number of metas, I hope that this puzzle scratched some solvers' 
meta itch. It was a really fun puzzle to construct, but also required a decent of effort. Surprisingly, the testsolves went super smoothly. With the first two solo tests being unspoiled and hintless, the puzzle required very few revisions. Hope that you liked Puzzle Santa's presents!</p>

<p>To finish, here is a bonus present! This one was left over from when I was trying to make winter-themed 
metas. Though perhaps it is easier without the meta-matching aspect, you can try it out if you want.</p>
