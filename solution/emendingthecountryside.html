    <p>The final puzzle of the hunt takes us through some familiar places.</p>
<p>The puzzle consists of short clues and long clues with numbers, arranged in a checkerboard pattern. While we'll quickly find out that the short clues are too vague to solve on their own, the long clues should soon remind us of the puzzles we've previously solved. Specifically, there are 23 clues like this, and each of them describes one of the 23 feeder puzzles in the hunt. However, each of these descriptions has a word that doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the sentence.</p>
<p>It is possible to emend these descriptions by applying a certain transformation to each of the unfitting words such that they make sense - by changing one of the letters to "CL". The numbers next to these clues indicate Caesar shifts. By taking the letters that got changed, and shifting them appropriately, we can get a helpful clue by reading them in the given order:</p>

<p>Taking the shifted letters gives us the clue "READ IN ORDER BY BOND CENTRE". Together with the presence of "Cl" words, as well as the checkerboard layout of the grid, and the answer to <em>The Four Season Theorem</em> (SALT), this should remind us of the chemical structure of salt, NaCl. With the cells cluing puzzles all having a "CL" word, this suggests that the remaining cells should have "Na" words. Also, the fact that the previous puzzles are being clued here suggests that we should revisit them.</p>
<p>And that's where we will be able to find our Na words. But where exactly do our "tasteful advice" and "ingredients" lie? With careful examination, we should be able to find a word in the flavour text of each puzzle which can have one of its letters replaced with Na. Each of these words can be used to answer one of the small clues on the grid. In all cases, the clue is adjacent to the puzzle description, which allows us to both disambiguate which clue corresponds to which answer, and which word in the flavour text is transformed (in the case of puzzles that have multiple Na-able words).</p>
<p>The letters that got changed, when read in order by bond centre, will give us the final puzzle answer:</p>

<p>The final answer is <strong>A STITCH IN THYME SAVES FOUR</strong>.</p>

    
    
    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>This was the final puzzle made for the hunt. The puzzle, themed as a runaround revisiting the previous puzzles, was conceived after the two-round structure of the hunt was finalized, partially because the Four Season Theorem's answer, SALT, was still not a satisfying conclusion to our story. However, it was still useful as a device in our story. With the seasoning salt, we were finally able to emend the countryside, and by using one piece from each puzzle, we learned that A STITCH IN THYME SAVES FOUR and brought the countryside and seasons back to life. Also, the addition of this puzzle bumped our puzzle count up to 26, which is a very significant number to puzzlers, because it is the number of letters in the English alphabet.</p>
<p>The idea for this puzzle was based on salt's formula and molecular structure, with the usage of flavour text specifically being tied to "seasoning". Luckily, it wasn't too hard to find Na words that give all the letters we need, though we had to retouch most flavour texts to accommodate the words, and use some strange words, like "naunts" and "nare". The cluephrase from the Cl words was given with Caesar shifts, because it was impossible to find enough vowels that change to Cl to make valid words. We also had to make sure to remove ambiguities as to which Na word to use from which flavour text. That's where the domino-matching component of the puzzle comes into play.</p>
<p>We were aiming for this puzzle to be a nice finish to the hunt, and with moderate difficulty. However, testsolvers have found it harder than expected, so we decided to give a stronger clue in the flavour text (namely, "tasteful advice"), and give an explicit notice that answers are not used. Still, we hope that you enjoyed emending the countryside. Thank you so much for participating in our hunt!</p>
