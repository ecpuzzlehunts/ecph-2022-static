<h4>Blockbusters - by quatrevingtneuf</h4>
<p>In the show, contestants answer trivia questions in the form “What [letter] [question]” in order to 
  claim a letter space on the board. The answers to the questions are as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Clue</th>
<th>Answer</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>What N might have a special habit?</td>
<td>NUN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What R gets counted in a game of baseball?</td>
<td>RUN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What P is a common vegetable?</td>
<td>PEA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What C is a social deduction board game?</td>
<td>COUP</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What Q might you catch a ferry at?</td>
<td>QUAY</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What D is a colour for a horse?</td>
<td>DUN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What G is a sort of sandwich?</td>
<td>GYRO</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Perhaps by saying the words out loud, solvers will notice that the words rhyme with numbers. The 
  letters only appear once each on the given board, so we know to match the answers up directly and 
  place numbers on the board. From here, we proceed as with a game of minesweeper (the number gives 
  how many of the surrounding six hexagons should be marked).</p>
<p><center><img src="../static/puzzle_resources/backtoschool/sol01_nsou.20fccd62ff09.png" width="80%"><br></center></p>
<p>Taking the marked cells in reading order yields the answer to this subpuzzle, <strong>SMITH</strong>. </p>

<h4>Chain Reaction - by quatrevingtneuf</h4>
<p>Chain Reaction is normally a show about word association. Here, each of the clues here clues a 
  two-letter "word". Considering "reaction" in the name of the show, we may suspect that the answers 
  are related to elements. Indeed, we should fill in the middle gap with the chemical element that 
  comes in between.</p>

<h4>The Chase - by chimpaznee</h4>
<p>The questions seem like they are all missing something.</p>
<p>If we do some research about the UK version of The Chase, we can find out that it has six chasers. If we consider the nicknames of the chasers, we can find unique answers to the questions, such that each question is connected to one of the chasers (we'll have use context clues to figure out which chaser fits which question).</p>

<div class="nested-solution countdown">
<p><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../static/puzzle_resources/backtoschool/backtoschool.84d3b7af624c.css" /></p>
<h4>Countdown - by quatrevingtneuf</h4>
<p>One segment in Countdown involves unscrambling nine letters to form the longest word possible. In this 
  subpuzzle, we are faced with Chinese characters instead. Searching them together, we find that these are 
  all radicals used when typing with the Cangjie input method, one of many ways to type Chinese. To give 
  solvers somewhere to start, a couple radicals are given. Either by trial and error, or by searching a 
  list, we can eventually find the anagram we need. The sequence "月山日女 月山手一月" produces the 
  characters "眼睛", which translate to this subpuzzle's answer, <strong>EYE</strong>.</p>

<p><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../static/puzzle_resources/backtoschool/backtoschool.84d3b7af624c.css" /></p>
<h4>Family Feud - by eanacra</h4>
<p>In Family Feud, contestants aim to come up with the most popular answer to questions. The break-in to this sub-puzzle is most easily found via the fourth board where OXYGEN and TITANIUM are the only two answers with non-zero score. Indeed, both of these are chemical elements and their scores are equal to the element’s atomic numbers. This is further confirmed by the title "Infinitesimal Amount". From here, we infer that in each board the score of an answer is calculated by a fixed rule clued by the title (by default, the score is 0 if the answer does not satisfy a condition of the rule). We should then pick the answer that scores the highest for each question.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rule</th>
<th>Question</th>

<p>The first letters of the titles spell ASCII. Since the highest scores are in the ASCII range for uppercase letters, we can convert them to letters, thus producing the subpuzzle answer: <strong>SMART</strong>.</p>

<h4>Jeopardy! - by quatrevingtneuf</h4>
<p>We begin by answering the trivia questions, which are generally fairly straightforward:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Clue</th>
<th>Answer</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A Canadian Olympian named Alex did this to win Canada's first ever medal in this Winter Olympic event. (5)</td>
<td>LUGED</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This synonym of "strenuous" or "laborious" may also appear in discussions of fiscal policy. (6)</td>
<td>TAXING</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Algorithms such as the T permutation exchange the positions of four of these. (6)</td>
<td>CUBIES</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The maximum size of this in the NFL is 7 greater than that for the CFL. (6)</td>
<td>ROSTER</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Sk8r Boi" by Avril Lavigne follows a similar chord progression to this famous piece in D major. (5)</td>
<td>CANON</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As we might realize when considering "Daily Double", each of these clue answers can have one of their 
  letters doubled to form a new valid word:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Original</th>
<th>Doubled</th>
<th>Letter</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>LUGED</td>
<td>LUGGED</td>
<td>G</td>

<p>After one more letter doubling, we get our subpuzzle answer: <strong>GIBBON</strong>.</p>

<div class="nested-solution mastermind">
<p><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../static/puzzle_resources/backtoschool/backtoschool.84d3b7af624c.css" /></p>
<h4>Mastermind - by eanacra</h4>
<p>We are presented with six questions. The first unusual thing we might notice is the inclusion of the phrase “I’ve started so I’ll finish” in the middle of the last question. This is in fact the catchphrase of the Mastermind presenter Magnus Magnusson who said it whenever the time ran out while he was reading a question on the show. This suggests we should pay attention to the order of the questions.</p>
<p>Next, we turn to the questions themselves but they seem to be very ambiguous. Nevertheless, after listing a few answer candidates for each question, we might notice, for example, the answer SORT works for both the second-last question and the last question. This leads to the gimmick of this subpuzzle: the contestant’s specialist subject is “answering two consecutive questions at the same time”. The questions are given in the order they are asked.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Answer 1</th>
<th>Answer 2</th>

<tr>
<td>What word do you get when the last letter is removed from an alcoholic drink?</td>

<h4>Merv Griffin's Crosswords - by chimpaznee</h4>
<p>This is a divided 9x9 crossword with a lot of special entries in 2 different colors, and two unclued entries. We can start by solving it like a normal crossword. But we'll quickly find out that none of the special entries fit into the grid.</p>
<p>Instead, each special entry must be transformed in one of two ways before being entered (based on its colour and which half of the grid it is found in). The orange entries must be entered as completions of compound words or phrases, and the blue entries must by entered as rhymes.</p>
<p>Here is the filled-in grid:</p>

<p>The answers to the two unclued entries are LAUD (in the blue region) and CAST (in the orange region). To find the final answer, we should find a rhyme of LAUD that can have "CAST" appended to it to form a compound word or phrase. The subpuzzle answer is a five-letter long word that satisfies both of these conditions - <strong>BROAD</strong>.</p>

<h4>Pointless - by eanacra</h4>
<p>Pointless is a show where contestants try to come up with answers that the least people thought of. A “Pointless” answer is one that none of the 100 people gave. In this subpuzzle we are given 6 categories and the title “Pointless Things”, so the logical thing to try is to find the “Pointless” answer in each category.</p>
<p>By looking at the list of members for each set, one should spot a commonality between all 6 sets — they each contain something with the thematic substring NIL (this is most easily seen in NIL RECURRING or ONE NIL where the substring is not “hidden”). We can then extract a letter from each entry by going left or right (depending on the arrow’s direction) by the given number, starting at NIL.</p>

<h4>The Price is Right - by quatrevingtneuf</h4>
<p>Each of the items has been assigned a "price", but these certainly aren't things you would normally buy. 
  All of the words are 3 letters long, which helps with identification:</p>
<p><tt>
  CAT<br />
  HAT<br />
  ANT<br />
  MAN<br />
  POP<br />
  EAR<br />
  ROW<br />
  NET<br />
  ONE<br />
  WAX<br />
  NAP<br />
  EVE
  </tt></p>
<p>Reading the first letters gives us the clue CHAMPERNOWNE. 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champernowne_constant">Champernowne's constant</a> can be 
  generated by listing all the numbers in a given base in order (following a decimal point). If we try the 
  same thing with letters (i.e. ABC...XYZAAABAC...ZXZYZZAAAAAB...), the first occurrence of each of the 
  words above is at the index given by its "price". Notice that if had missed the CHAMPERNOWNE clue, we 
  may have been able to surmise this rule from a couple patterns (the small gap between CAT and HAT, "price" 
  in a similar order of magnitude for POP/EVE and MAN/WAX, higher "prices" for words where all the letters 
  appear later in the alphabet, etc.).</p>
<p>Now all that's left to do is to find the word that appears at the index with the question mark underneath. 
  It's probably easiest to calculate this or write a simple script for it (note that sheets formulae won't 
  easily be able generate the string because it's too long). At that position, you'll find the answer, <strong>NAVY</strong>.</p>

<h4>Taskmaster - by eanacra</h4>
<p>We are given 14 instructions in order so we might try to follow them immediately. However, we soon get stuck at step 10 where we are asked to anagram everything to form an uncapitalized noun. Instead, we should search for the 14 names and realize that they are names of Taskmasters and Taskmaster’s Assistants in various (international) versions of Taskmaster. In the style of the game Simon Says, we should then only perform the instructions given by a Taskmaster. If we only perform the instructions given by an Assistant, we end up with the phrase RED HERRING. The table below shows the results following each step:</p>

<h4>Tenable - by eanacra</h4>
<p>In Tenable, contestants are asked to name 10 items in an ordered list. In this subpuzzle, we are not told the name of the list, but instead given the enumerations of all 10 items along with 3 letters for extra confirmation.</p>
<p>Entering the longer phrases into <a href="https://nutrimatic.org/">Nutrimatic</a href> will help solve most of these categories easily. To solve the first list, it might help to conjecture that the answers start with consecutive letters of the alphabet. The lists are presented in alphabetical order of the title, though solvers need not understand this to solve the subpuzzle and there isn’t a standard way of describing them anyway.</p>

<h4>University Challenge - by eanacra</h4>
<p>We are presented with 6 images each accompanied by a number after a double-headed arrow. One can reverse image search these images easily, but as expected indexing into the names immediately doesn’t result in a word. Having a basic understanding of how the show works is helpful here — as explained in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Challenge">the show’s Wikipedia article</a href>, teams consist of 4 members and represent a university, except the colleges of the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford are allowed to enter independent teams. Even without this knowledge, a search of “university” with some key words from the titles of the artwork will eventually lead us to the realization that each image clues a Cambridge or Oxford college.</p>
<p>What does the double-headed arrow represent? With this new discovery, we might guess that each Cambridge college is connected in some way with an Oxford college. Indeed, clued by the instruction "Identify the sibling in each case", we find that every college has a sister college in the other university. (Be careful not to confuse Oxford’s St Cath<strong>e</strong>rine’s College with Cambridge’s St Cath<strong>a</strong>rine’s College.)</p>

<p>On the show, contestants are able to "bank" money earned from previous answers by saying "bank". Treating 
  the answers to all the questions as a single string (as suggested by the formatting of the questions),
  we find substrings that are currencies that we can "bank":</p>

<h4>Wheel of Fortune - by quatrevingtneuf</h4>
<p>If we simply try to fill in the blanks as normal, we may not find satisfying phrases for a couple of

  become Ms when rotated. The completed phrases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR</li>
<li>BICYCLE KICK</li>
<li>INKAY EVOLVING INTO MALAMAR</li>
<li>BUNDT CAKE</li>

<h4>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? - by eanacra</h4>
<p>We are presented with 4 multiple-choice questions in the style of the show along with a bar chart and an image showing three lifelines. We can quickly notice that each question contains a number and 3 of these numbers do not make sense. We should use the lifelines! First, apply the “50:50” lifeline to half the numbers in each question (they are all even). Now that the questions make sense, we can proceed to answer them. It turns out all the answers are exactly 5 letters long, equal to the number of digits in each option. This is where the second lifeline “Phone a Friend” comes into play — we can convert each letter to a number via the mapping on a telephone keypad (e.g. D/E/F equals 3) and one of the options is the correct answer. Now observe that the 4 correct answers come from distinct options so we should sort them by the option letter (the questions are presented in alphabetical order).</p>
<p>How do we extract the answer now? By invoking the final lifeline “Ask the Audience”. The lifeline yielded the percentages 20%, 20%, 40%, 20% respectively and since 20% of 5 is 1, we extract the first letters of the answers corresponding to options A, B, D and the first two letters of the answer corresponding to option C.</p>

<p>In true Only Connect fashion, we find the final link between these four films/shows: they all 
prominently feature <strong>ROWAN ATKINSON</strong>, the final answer to this puzzle.</p>

    
    
    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>By coincidence, this puzzle has the structure of the main round — 4 groups of 4 answers contributing to a 
meta! The initial idea for this puzzle was completely different but was scrapped as it significantly 
overlapped with a past MIT Mystery Hunt puzzle. We placed this puzzle at the first half of the main round to 
encourage more teams to try it because we know it will take a long time due to the large number of 
subpuzzles. Most subpuzzles underwent revision after testsolving in an effort to make them easier 
and this was the last puzzle in the seasons round to pass testsolving.</p>
<p>We aimed to make the “bean” puzzles harder on average compared to the other 3 sets since it was a lot 
easier to get the answer with MR BEAN. We considered whether we should replace MR BEAN with a less 
obvious film, provide enumerations or the movie camera emoji for Only Connect, but ultimately we decided 
to be as generous as possible because the puzzle was already quite long. However, the presence of enumerations has resulted in testsolvers short-circuiting the connecting wall (with a hyphenated 6-3 being very specific), so we tried to test it without them. Fortunately, we managed to get a successful test of the wall in this state.</p>
<p><strong>Blockbusters:</strong> It seems that many people got caught up on the pronunciation of QUAY, which incidentally also appears in a homophone clue in another puzzle in the hunt.</p>
<p><strong>The Chase:</strong> The third question used to be "What is commonly associated with Squidward?" with the answer being WRATH (a sin). This tripped up testsolvers, so (un)fortunately, the puzzle is now free of any SpongeBob SquarePants fan theories!</p>
<p><strong>Countdown:</strong> This idea came to me while playing <a href="https://samuello.io/jndle/">JNDLE</a>. I don't type with this method, but I do find it interesting. Originally, I didn't want to provide any givens, but this was ultimately deemed too cruel for 1/16th of a puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>Family Feud:</strong> To my surprise, most testsolvers were completely stuck on this subpuzzle despite the fairly standard atomic number in board 4. As a result, I added the titles to simplify the subpuzzle and clue the extraction.</p>
<p><strong>Jeopardy!:</strong> I love luge.</p>
<p><strong>Mastermind:</strong> This entire puzzle was partly inspired by thinking about writing a puzzle in the style of this subpuzzle. Originally the questions were not sorted in the extraction order and the second-last question was harder, but this was changed after no testsolvers solved this subpuzzle.</p>
<p><strong>Pointless:</strong> I’m not entirely satisfied with the current puzzle as it doesn’t fully utilize the interesting Pointless format.</p>
<p><strong>Taskmaster:</strong> This was inspired by <a href="https://taskmaster.fandom.com/wiki/Stand_on_one_leg_for_the_longest">the studio task in Series 5 Episode 4</a href> which involved a game of “Greg says, Alex says”.</p>
<p><strong>Tenable:</strong> I had to rewrite this subpuzzle after Boris Johnson resigned because one of the lists was “The 10 most recent British prime ministers”.</p>
<p><strong>Who Wants to be a Millionaire:</strong> This is my favourite sub-puzzle out of the 7 that I wrote, because it uses elements of the show very well and is still very accessible at the same time.</p>
