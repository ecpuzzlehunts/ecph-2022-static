    <p>This is a PictureGame-style puzzle! </p>
<p>In this puzzle, we are given 18 images of locations around the world taken from Google Street View, and need to identify them. However, the butterflies block attempts at reverse image searching the landmarks, so we will need to devise a solve path for each image based on what we see. For that, it is often helpful to describe the things in the picture to a search engine (e.g. suspension bridge, clock tower, statue), use any visible flags to narrow down the location, or look up any visible text to get additional clues.</p>
<p>The flavour text mentions cities, so we should note down the city where each picture was taken:</p>

</table>
<p>Indexing into the names of the cities with the number of butterflies, we get the clue SEE GEN VI BUG POKEMON.</p>
<p>Solvers will now need to do some research. There are three Bug pokemon in Gen VI that are not Mega Evolutions: The Pure Bug-type Scatterbug and Spewpa and the dual-type Bug/Flying Vivillon. Since the puzzle primarily deals with butterflies, the relevant Pokemon is Vivillon (and submitting it in the answer checker will give a confirmation). </p>
<p>Vivillon has 18 different wing patterns (and 2 additional limited patterns), which are dependent on the player's real-world location. The locations are fairly well-defined, and both <a href="https://media.pocketmonsters.net/pages/506/Vivillon-Weltkarte.png">a map</a href> and <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_with_form_differences#Vivillon">a list</a href> of them can be found online. We should now go back to the cities we found, and check which Vivillon pattern can be found in which city. With 18 different patterns for 18 cities around the world, each pattern appears in exactly one of the cities featured in this puzzle:</p>

<p>We will use the number of butterflies in each image again as an index, this time indexing into the Vivillon patterns to get the message DESIGN A WING PATTERN.</p>
<p>During the hunt, when teams submitted this message, they received an instruction to design a new wing pattern to represent their team, and send it to us via email. After submitting their designs, teams received a reply containing the puzzle answer, <strong>APPROACHING STORM</strong>.</p>

    <p>chimpaznee: We wanted to include one puzzle in this hunt that would be reminiscent of rounds on r/PictureGame, or at least use its concept of image-based solve paths. Work on the puzzle started when ev shared the idea of a Vivillon puzzle with me. We thought for a while about how to clue the locations, then I suggested turning this into an geography-image-based puzzle.</p>
<p>While we tried to find images for which there was a relatively simple solve path, we were still afraid that solvers who are not familiar with PictureGame will have a very hard time with these. Fortunately, we also have a few people on our team who haven't played PictureGame before, and the internal testsolves showed that the puzzle can probably be manageable the general puzzle community. While we had a couple of harder-to-find locations (such as the ones in Turku and Taichung), we hope that most of the locations were reasonable to find.</p>
<p>We were expecting this puzzle to be solved by very few teams, because of the niche skills we thought are required. However we were extremely pleasantly surprised by the large amount of wing patterns sent out way, with over 80 teams creating one. Several people have even told us that this was their single favourite puzzle of the hunt! To these people, and everyone else who has given this puzzle a shot, thank you so much for trying out our PictureGame-style puzzle!</p>
<p>During the hunt, the location for image N was Nagasaki Peace Park. However, a keen-eyed solver found out that the Vivillon pattern found in Nagasaki is Continental, rather than the Elegant pattern found in most of Japan. This was noticed nearly a week after the hunt began, after more than 60 teams have already solved the puzzle. Correcting the erratum would have required creating a whole new image, so in the interest of fairness, we decided to update the image only after the hunt ended.</p>
