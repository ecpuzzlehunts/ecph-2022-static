<h1>Announcements</h1>
<h2>Wrap-up released!</h2> <!-- FIXME on new popup -->
<p>Hi puzzlers!</p>

<p>Thank you so much for Exploring the Countryside with us!</p>

<p>We've finally finished collecting hunt statistics, your stories, our reflections, answers to your questions, and other final things which we are excited to share with you in the <a href="wrapup.html">wrap-up</a>.</p>

<p>We have also had a great time writing and running this hunt! If you still haven't filled the post-hunt survey, we would appreciate hearing your thoughts on the hunt via this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeC7YUO1lGXh92St44XnBjSuzjCwDYAJvswrkylXSr4CmwofA/viewform?usp=sf_link">feedback form</a>.</p>
            
<p>Sincerely,<br>
ECs of /r/PictureGame</p>

<h2>Exploring the Countryside has ended!</h2> <!-- FIXME on new popup -->
<p>Hi puzzlers!</p>

<p>The hunt has now ended. The leaderboard has now been frozen, and solutions released. Though if you want to keep solving at your own pace, the puzzles will remain active, and you'll be able to progress by submitting answers until we lock out submission at <strong>Monday, October 24 at 12:00 AM EDT</strong> (that's a week from now). Hints will no longer be available through the website.</p>

<p>If you have any interesting stories to share with us, questions to ask, or any additional inquiries, we'll continue monitoring emails, but our response time may be slower than during the hunt.</p>

<p>We would also appreciate hearing your thoughts on the hunt via this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeC7YUO1lGXh92St44XnBjSuzjCwDYAJvswrkylXSr4CmwofA/viewform?usp=sf_link">feedback form</a>. We'll include stories that you share with us in the wrap-up, as well as answers to questions you ask us.</p>

<p>We'll release the wrap-up in a few days, once it is ready. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
ECs of /r/PictureGame</p>

<h2>Four final hints</h2> <!-- FIXME on new popup -->
<p>Hi puzzlers!</p>

<p>Hope you're enjoying the hunt so far!</p>

<p>For the final batch of hints, which was just released at 4:00 PM UTC/noon EDT, we have given teams 4 hint tokens instead of the usual 2. This is to give teams more support before the hunt ends.</p>

<p>The hunt will end 12 hours from this message's publication, at 4:00 AM UTC/midnight EDT.</p>

<p>Good luck and happy puzzling!</p>

<p>Sincerely<br>
ECs of /r/PictureGame</p>

<h2>Hints are now available!</h2> <!-- FIXME on new popup -->
<p>Hi puzzlers!</p>

<p>We've just released the first batch of hints. We decided to give one hint that will be usable on any puzzle on the hunt, and one hint that is only usable on the first set of puzzles. (<strong>This is different from what was said previously; to emphasize, one of these hints is also usable on puzzles after the first round.</strong>)</p>
  
<p>Also, please note that due to ongoing issues with our email provider, you may not receive email notifications for hint responses, and you may also receive emails from <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="aacfc9dadfd0d0c6cfc2dfc4ded9eacdc7cbc3c684c9c5c7">[email&#160;protected]</a> instead of <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1071747d797e50757360783e637964753e">[email&#160;protected]</a> We apologize for any inconvenience. (You may also notice that your email has been added to a Google Group for similar reasons; it turns out this didn't work either, oops.)</p>
  
  <p>We'll keep releasing two hints every day at 4:00 PM UTC (12:00 PM EDT). The hints released in the following days will be usable on any puzzle.</p>
  
<p>Happy puzzling!</p>
  
<p>Sincerely,<br>
  ECs of /r/PictureGame</p>
