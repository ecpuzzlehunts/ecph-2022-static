⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

It is a coincidence the second of the Northern mansions has the same name as the second animal of the year. Come to my place instead - it is by no coincidence the second (or third) most famous shopping street."

I am intimately familiar with having nothing but a shabby lodging. Looking at all of the other 27 mansionsneatly lined up in a circle, I can't help but resonate with the one mansion of empty ruins I am in."

Apparently a famous charioteer lived in this mansion around the year 950 BC... If he was still alive, he would have brought you to our place instead, which is the most visited!"
"Johnny Carson

⭐⭐⭐

Shiniest and biggest star of the lot but I still do not recommend it - my place is unpopular and is a dead end, but somehow it is still more worth it!"
"Joseph Merrick
15th September
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Happily surprised when I got more than double what I expected. Back home, I was widely considered a freak and stayed at one of the cheaper places, so this change of pace was a welcome one."
"Leslie Green

Confusing names - thought the mansion next to mine was the place I booked due to how it looked, but it turns out that the mansions' names are Chinese! Also, if you are looking for somewhere quiet, check out my place!"

They have a deity to deal with monsters. Not sure if that is better than using animals....not that we have monsters here!"
"Passionate Muggle

This is like trying to get to platform nine and three quarters :/"

Compared to my place which is right next to a jail, this place is like...incomparably better."
"Polly the Parrot

⭐⭐

The first of the Eastern mansions, but not first in my heart! That'd be Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese - though it's a pub!"
"Pubeertea Lads
6th July
⭐⭐⭐⭐

While my place is the only one named after a building, at least I wasn't named after a vehicle!"
"Robert Sidney

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Meh. The mansion is near the back end, so the view is meh."
"Sarah Bentley

⭐⭐⭐⭐

Literal feces. I already have to deal with it at work, but here too???"
"Sherlock Holmes
6th October
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Pssst! Over at my place, there is a pub named after me with great deals!"
"The Government
2nd March
⭐⭐⭐⭐

Be warned! Executions are still a thing here!"
"Thomas Bond

I have to say, what they served didn't taste very good. I probably felt more satisfied just looking at the art along my street."
