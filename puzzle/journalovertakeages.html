<p class="flavor">I documented all my thoughts during my spring break vacation, though I scrambled to get down the countries.</p>
<p>4/6: A US Marine approached me.<br />
The look on his face was <em>terrible, like a wolf</em>, but he assured me that I'll be safe from any <em>hazard</em>.</p>
<p>5/4: Boarded a plane.<br />
After it landed, I decided to <em>skulk</em> around the local markets, looking for a good <em>container for soup</em> to buy.</p>
<p>5/4: I also hike a lot!<br />
I could <em>talk</em> a lot about it and never <em>cease</em> doing it.</p>
<p>5/5: I played baseball with a cub from the bear shelter.<br />
It would <em>throw the ball</em> at me, and I'd bat. After that, I went to <em>cleanse</em> myself of the grime in the nearest hot springs.</p>
<p>4/4: I put my new suit in a closet.<br />
Then I went to a museum to observe works from an <em>avant-garde art movement</em>. They've got this <em>magical energy</em>.</p>
<p>6/5: I saw an army man at the military history museum.<br />
I also thought it was much <em>more creative</em> than my last visit. Just yesterday, they put a new painting on display, featuring a <em>long, sharp projectile</em> and a bow.</p>
<p>4/5: I'm a serial photographer.<br />
Today I <em>took a picture</em> of a <em>group of insects</em>.</p>
<p>5/4: It will rain later today.<br />
This is an opportunity to watch the locals engage in a painful tradition: a <em>dance that includes bending under a bar</em> while stepping on <em>plastic toy bricks</em> while it is pouring.</p>
<p>6/5: Made a mistaken turn while driving.<br />
But it turned out good, as I met the <em>star of Tapeheads</em> on the way! I think my love for him has just been <em>raised to the third power</em>.</p>
<p>4/5: My left leg pains me today.<br />
And also it is <em>freezing</em> outside. Good thing the birds are <em>confined</em> indoors and safe.</p>
<p>5/6: No awry situation distresses me.<br />
In bad days, I like to sit down, listen to music from <em>the band that made the "Numa Numa" song</em>, and eat a <em>citrus fruit</em>.</p>
<p>4/4: One excessive sun ray is of no concern to me.<br />
I <em>was on horseback</em> for many hours, taking in the day's heat with my <em>exposed</em> skin.</p>
<p>5/6: Relaxing in a garden is a pleasant activity.<br />
A very good way to <em>start</em> the day is to listen to my favourite <em>song from The Defamation of Strickland Banks</em> while doing it.</p>
<p>4/4: There was a lot of noise at the bar!<br />
That's just the <em>truth</em>, and unfortunately a <em>shortcoming</em> of the otherwise perfect night I had.</p>
<p>7/4: Today I hit a cactus.<br />
I think my <em>screaming</em> could be heard from very far away, so I <em>am going to</em> try to keep shut in the future.</p>
